# Get Started: Application Development using CCF

# Overview

What is CCF: The [Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF)](https://ccf.dev/) is an open-source framework for building a new category of secure, highly available,
and performant applications that focus on multi-party compute and data.

- Read the [CCF overview](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/overview/index.html) and get familiar with [CCF's core concepts](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/overview/what_is_ccf.html) and [Azure confidential computing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/confidential-computing/)

CCF apps can also be written in JavaScript or Typescript, To test a ccf application you need go through the following steps:

- Start a CCF Network with at least one node
- Initialize the CCF network with at least one (active member - user), this can be done through [Network Governance Proposals](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/proposals.html).
- Create an application [deployment proposal](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/build_apps/js_app_bundle.html)
- Submit the app deployment proposal to the network and all members accept it through voting. This is a part of [Network Governance](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/proposals.html).
- Open the CCF network for users
- Start to test your application endpoints

### Build Application

The application building prerequisites [[CCF](#ccf-install), NodeJS and NPM] must be installed,all will be preinstalled if you are using devcontainer environment, otherwise you need to install them manually .

In the checkout of [ccf-app-samples](https://github.com/microsoft/ccf-app-samples) repository:

```bash
# carried out on the dev-container start up
cd banking-app && npm install

# build and generate the application bundle and deployment proposal
make build

# a dist folder is created with app bundle and deployment proposal.
```

### Testing your Application

There are several approaches to test your application

- [Sandbox.sh](#testing-using-sandboxsh)

  - Build an initialized CCF network and automatically deploy your app on top of it
  - Support both ccf network types [virtual - enclave (TEE hardware)]
  - No governance steps required

- [Docker container](#testing-using-docker-containers)

  - Support both ccf network types [virtual - enclave (TEE hardware)]
  - Governance steps required to deploy your app, initialize, and start the network

- [Azure Virtual Machine (Linux)](#testing-using-azure-virtual-machine)

  - Support both ccf network types [virtual - enclave (TEE hardware)]
  - Governance steps required to deploy your app, initialize, and start the network

- [Azure Managed CCF](#testing-using-azure-managed-ccf)

  - Support only a ccf network in enclave mode (TEE hardware)
  - No governance steps required to start up your network, but you need to use governance to propose your application

### Testing: Using Sandbox.sh

By running sandbox.sh script, it is automatically starts a CCF network and deploys your application on it.
The app is up and ready to receive calls and all the governance work is done for you.

Start in a CCF Network in Enclave mode

```bash
/opt/ccf/bin/sandbox.sh --js-app-bundle ./banking-app/dist/  --enclave-type release -p /opt/ccf/lib/libjs.enclave.so.signed
...
[12:00:00.000] Press Ctrl+C to shutdown the network
# It is then possible to interact with the service
```

Start in a CCF Network in Virtual mode (the default mode for testing)

```bash
/opt/ccf/bin/sandbox.sh --js-app-bundle ./banking-app/dist/
...
[12:00:00.000] Press Ctrl+C to shutdown the network
# It is then possible to interact with the service
```

### Testing: Using docker containers

Build and run one of these docker files ["ccf_app_js.virtual" or "ccf_app_js.enclave"] to start a CCF network with one node and one member.
After that, you need to execute governance steps to deploy the application and open the network for users to begin access the app endpoints.
All the governance steps need to be done manually using [proposal submit and vote process](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/proposals.html).

#### Build and run docker container to start a CCF network

Start in a CCF Network in Enclave mode, via docker container based on config file "./config/cchost_config_enclave_js.json"

```bash
 docker build -t ccf-app-samples:js-enclave -f docker/ccf_app_js.enclave .
 docker run -d --device /dev/sgx_enclave:/dev/sgx_enclave --device /dev/sgx_provision:/dev/sgx_provision -v /dev/sgx:/dev/sgx ccf-app-samples:js-enclave
 ...
 # CCF Network initialization needed before the interaction with the service
```

Start in a CCF Network in Virtual mode, based on virtual config file: "./config/cchost_config_virtual_js.json":

```bash
 docker build -t ccf-app-samples:js-virtual -f docker/ccf_app_js.virtual .
 docker run -d ccf-app-samples:js-virtual
 ...
 # CCF Network initialization needed before the interaction with the service
```

Now, a network is started with one node and one member, you need to execute the following governance steps to initialize the network, [check Network governance section](#network-governance)

- Activate the network existing member (to start a network governance)
- Build the application and [create a deployment proposal](#build-application)
- Deploy the application proposal, [using governance calls](#network-governance)
- Optionally Create and submit [an add users proposal](#new-user-proposal)
- Open the network for users ([using proposal](#open-network-proposal))

#### CCF Node Configuration file

To start or join new node you need some configs, The configuration for each CCF node must be contained in a single JSON configuration file like [cchost_config_enclave_js.json - cchost_config_virtual_js.json], [CCF node config file documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/operations/configuration.html)

### Testing: Using Azure Virtual Machine

To Start a test CCF network on a VM, it requires [CCF to be intalled](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/build_apps/install_bin.html).

To create a ready CCF VM please check [Creating a Virtual Machine in Azure to run CCF](https://github.com/microsoft/CCF/blob/main/getting_started/azure_vm/README.md)

Start the CCF network using the cchost in enclave mode

```bash
 /opt/ccf/bin/cchost --config ./config/cchost_config_enclave_js.json
 ...
 # CCF Network initialization needed before the interaction with the service
```

Or virtual mode

```bash
/opt/ccf/bin/cchost --config ./config/cchost_config_virtual_js.json
...
 # CCF Network initialization needed before the interaction with the service
```

Now, a network is started with one node and one member, you need to execute the following governance steps to initialize the network, [check Network governance section](#network-governance)

- Activate the network existing member (to start a network governance)
- Build the application and [create a deployment proposal](#build-application)
- Deploy the application proposal, [using governance calls](#network-governance)
- Create and submit [an add users proposal](#new-user-proposal)
- Open the network for users ([using proposal](#open-network-proposal))

#### CCF Node Configuration file

To start or join new node you need some configs, The configuration for each CCF node must be contained in a single JSON configuration file like [cchost_config_enclave_js.json - cchost_config_virtual_js.json], [ CCF node config file documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/operations/configuration.html)

### Testing: Using [Azure Managed CCF](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-confidential-computing/microsoft-introduces-preview-of-azure-managed-confidential/ba-p/3648986)

To test you application using Managed CCF, you can create Azure Managed CCF serivce on your subscription, the service will create a ready CCF network

- First, create the network's initial member certificate, please check [Certificates generation](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/release/3.x/governance/adding_member.html)
- Create a new Azure Managed CCF serivce (the initial member certificate required as input)
- Build the application and [create a deployment proposal](#build-application)
- Deploy the application proposal, [using governance calls](#network-governance)
- Create and submit [an add users proposal](#new-user-proposal)

### Testing: Application Endpoints

To check samples on how to test your application endpoints, please check these repositories.

- [Banking Application](https://github.com/microsoft/ccf-app-samples/tree/main/banking-app)
- [Template Application](https://github.com/microsoft/ccf-app-template)

CCF apps can also be written in C++. This offers better performance than JavaScript apps but requires a compilation step and a restart of the CCF node for deployment. please check [ccf-app-template](https://github.com/microsoft/ccf-app-template) repository.

The C++ sample app is located in the [`cpp/`](cpp/) directory.

### Build C++ app

In the checkout of [ccf-app-template](https://github.com/microsoft/ccf-app-template) repository:

```bash
 cd cpp/
 mkdir build && cd build
 CC="/opt/oe_lvi/clang-10" CXX="/opt/oe_lvi/clang++-10" cmake -GNinja ..
 ninja
 ls

#libccf_app.enclave.so.signed # SGX-enabled application
#libccf_app.virtual.so # Virtual application (i.e. insecure!)
```

### Run C++ app: Using Sandbox.sh

```bash
$ /opt/ccf/bin/sandbox.sh -p ./libccf_app.virtual.so
[12:00:00.000] Press Ctrl+C to shutdown the network
```

Or, for an SGX-enabled application (unavailable in development container): `$ /opt/ccf/bin/sandbox.sh -p ./libccf_app.enclave.so.signed -e release`

### Run C++ app: Using Docker

It is possible to build a runtime image of the C++ application via docker:

```bash
$ docker build -t ccf-app-template:cpp-enclave -f docker/ccf_app_cpp.enclave .
$ docker run --device /dev/sgx_enclave:/dev/sgx_enclave --device /dev/sgx_provision:/dev/sgx_provision -v /dev/sgx:/dev/sgx ccf-app-template:cpp-enclave

# Or, for the non-SGX (a.k.a. virtual) variant:

$ docker build -t ccf-app-template:cpp-virtual -f docker/ccf_app_cpp.virtual .
$ docker run ccf-app-template:virtual

# CCF Network initialization needed before the interaction with the service
```

## <img src="https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/release/3.x/_static/ccf.svg" height=40px /> Network Governance

a Consortium of trusted Members [governs the CCF network](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/index.html). members can submit proposals to CCF and these proposals are accepted based on the rules defined in the [Constitution](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/constitution.html).
Governance changes are submitted to a [network as Proposals](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/proposals.html), and put to a vote from members.

Submit a proposal

```bash
proposal0_out=$(/opt/ccf/bin/scurl.sh "https://ccf_service_url/gov/proposals" --cacert service_cert.pem --signing-key member0_privk.pem --signing-cert member0_cert.pem --data-binary @proposal.json -H "content-type: application/json")
proposal0_id=$( jq -r  '.proposal_id' <<< "${proposal0_out}" )
```

Members vote to accept or reject the proposal

```bash
/opt/ccf/bin/scurl.sh "https://ccf_service_url/gov/proposals/$proposal0_id/ballots" --cacert service_cert.pem --signing-key member0_privk.pem --signing-cert member0_cert.pem --data-binary @vote_accept.json -H "content-type: application/json" | jq
/opt/ccf/bin/scurl.sh "https://ccf_service_url/gov/proposals/$proposal0_id/ballots" --cacert service_cert.pem --signing-key member1_privk.pem --signing-cert member1_cert.pem --data-binary @vote_accept.json -H "content-type: application/json" | jq
```

```
Note: The initial member's certificate and private key, must be generated before starting a CCF network, please check [Certificates generation](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/release/3.x/governance/adding_member.html).
```

### Network Governance: Activating network members

By default the CCF network needs at least one member to be started, after the network is started this member must be activated.
[Adding or activating members](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/adding_member.html)

#### Activate member

```bash
curl "https://ccf_service_url/gov/ack/update_state_digest" -X POST --cacert service_cert.pem --key member0_privk.pem --cert member0_cert.pem --silent | jq > request.json
cat request.json
/opt/ccf/bin/scurl.sh "https://ccf_service_url/gov/ack"  --cacert service_cert.pem --signing-key member0_privk.pem --signing-cert member0_cert.pem --header "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @request.json
```

#### New member proposal

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "set_member",
      "args": {
        "cert": "member_cert",
        "encryption_pub_key": <member_encryption_pub_key>
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Network Governance: Adding users

Users directly interact with the application running in CCF. Their public identities should be voted in by members before they are allowed to issue requests

Once a CCF network is successfully started and an acceptable number of nodes have joined, members should vote to open the network to Users.
First, the identities of trusted users should be generated,see [Generating Member Keys and Certificates](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/adding_member.html#generating-member-keys-and-certificates) and [Adding Users docs](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/open_network.html)

#### New user proposal

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "set_user",
      "args": {
        "cert": <user_cert>
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Network Governance: Application deployment

The native format for JavaScript applications in CCF is a [JavaScript application bundle](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/build_apps/js_app_bundle.html), or short app bundle. A bundle can be wrapped directly into a governance proposal for deployment.

#### Application deployment proposal

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "set_js_app",
      "args": {
        "bundle": {
          "metadata": { "endpoints": {<endpoints>} },
          "modules": [<modules>]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Network Governance: Open network for users

Once users are added to the network, members should create a [proposal to open the network](https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/governance/open_network.html), Other members are then able to vote for the proposal using the returned proposal id.

Once the proposal has received enough votes under the rules of the Constitution (ie. ballots which evaluate to true), the network is opened to users.
It is only then that users are able to execute transactions on the deployed application.

#### Open network proposal

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "transition_service_to_open",
      "args": {
        "next_service_identity": <service_cert>
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
