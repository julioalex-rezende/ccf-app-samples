# FSI DEMO > CCF (Confidential Consortium Framework)

## Context

We are a Neutrino team 

## What is CCF?

The Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF) is an open-source framework for building a new category of secure, highly-available, and performant applications that focus on multi-party compute and data.

Leveraging the power of trusted execution environments (TEE, or enclave), decentralised systems concepts, and cryptography, CCF enables enterprise-ready multiparty systems.

CCF is based on web technologies: clients interact with CCF JavaScript applications over HTTPS.
